            <h2>Hello,</h2>
            <p>
              I'm Jamieson DeAngelis. Photography, for me, has always been about holding on to moments before they slip away. I first picked up a camera because I loved noticing the small details others often missed, and I wanted a way to share that perspective. What began as simple documentation grew into something more intentional â€” a way to collect memories and capture the emotions that define them.<br><br>

              Since 2019, I've been exploring photography as both an art and a record of life's fleeting experiences. I started with landscapes and wildlife, drawn to the intricacy and beauty of the natural world. Over time, my focus expanded to people (friends, classmates, and communities) I enjoy being around. Whether it's the quiet warm glow of a marshland golden hour or the fluorescent exhilaration of a midnight Greek life party, I aim to capture not just the scene but the energy and feeling that made the moment matter.<br><br>

              People often describe my work as painterly and intimate, which I take as a compliment. I want my photos to feel like they belong in a gallery, while still depicting lived experiences. For me, photography isn't only about the image itself but about honoring the connection between place, subject, and memory.<br><br>

              Outside of photography, I'm someone who finds inspiration in creative pursuits like playing piano or drawing. I also have a habit of stopping mid-walk whenever I spot an interesting bird. Details, big or small, always catch my attention. Being attentive, patient, and curious fundamentally influences how I see and experience the world.<br><br>

              When I work with clients, I bring a calm and adaptable approach. I want the process to feel natural, collaborative, and enjoyable. My goal is for the people I photograph, whether students celebrating milestones or friends capturing memories, to look back and feel not only how they appeared in that moment, but also how it felt to be there.
